TODO:
- add README, describe file structure
- improve design (CSS)
  - json textarea

There are still plenty of TODOs to finish before starting these new features.
First things first :)

- object could be cloned through UI (button next to each object)
- allow to change prototype through user interface
- visualize prototype chain of objects
